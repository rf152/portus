portus
======

Portus is a project I put together to read data from a GPS device.

The aim was to be able to run the GPS and a Raspberry Pi from a battery,
and to attach them to a mobility scooter. The result would then be maps of
accessible walks around where I live, and anywhere else we happened to walk.

There are no install instructions (yet - I'll put some together when I have
finished writing the app!), and it may be a little rough around the edges!
